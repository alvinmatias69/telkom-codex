# Telkom Codex Backend

For this tourney we have two repositories. One for backend and one for frontend. For the frontend we write it using **Vue.js**. For the backend we use **typescript + expressjs**.

For the preview you can access it in [http://telkom-codex.herokuapp.com/](http://telkom-codex.herokuapp.com/). Unfortunately we deploy it in heroku, whereas it has sleep time and limited bandwidth, thus make it a bit harder to use.
